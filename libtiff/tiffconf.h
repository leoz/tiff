 * STRIPCHOP_DEFAULT	default handling of strip chopping support (whether

 *			to mutiple strips of ~8Kb--to reduce memory use)
 * DEFAULT_EXTRASAMPLE_AS_ALPHA
 *                      The RGBA interface will treat a fourth sample with
 *                      no EXTRASAMPLE_ value as being ASSOCALPHA.  Many
 *                      packages produce RGBA files but don't mark the alpha
 *                      properly.
 * CHECK_JPEG_YCBCR_SUBSAMPLING
 *                      Enable picking up YCbCr subsampling info from the
 *                      JPEG data stream to support files lacking the tag.
 *                      See Bug 168 in Bugzilla, and JPEGFixupTestSubsampling()
